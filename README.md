Mouse and touchpad automatic detector and sensitivity setter for Linux.

Ready to run: http://gasionet.pl/app/Micetweaks.jar

Application detects the moment when device is plugged into the USB port and sets individual config (speed and deceleration) to it.
Of course it may be used when using one mouse only.
"Must have app" especially when using KDE, where you can set mouse acceleration only.

At the begining it detects all connected pointers (like mice and touchpads) and shows window with those devices. There you can adjust it's speed and deceleration. After performed adjustment program can be closed. Every change is activated immediately. Config is saved at program's exit.

Dependency: xinput package and udevadm.
